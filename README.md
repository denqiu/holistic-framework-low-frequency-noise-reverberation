<h1>Holistic Framework on Low-Frequency Noise and Reverberation</h1>

<h2>Notice: Repository will be transferred to GitLab.</h2>

<h2>This framework reflects my personal experiences and self-conducted research on LFN and reverberation, supported by available evidence, though it remains my opinion. It is how I make sense of overwhelming experiences and it offers adaptive solutions to manage them. However, evidence may not always be conclusive. My reasoning could be wrong somewhere. i.e, overcomplicating a problem/solution, not considering other factors sharing common ground. Everyone offers different perspectives and I value feedback from that.</h2>

Overview:
<ul>
    <li>Visualize cause and effect of LFN and reverberation.</li>
    <li>Visualize solution.</li>
    <li>Provide context for the visuals.</li>
    <li>Techniques involved: Analogies, Data Analysis, System Design, and Supply Chain and Logistics.</li>
</ul>
